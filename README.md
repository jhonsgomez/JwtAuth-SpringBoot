## JwtAuth-SprinBoot (By: Jhon Gomez)
In a Spring Boot application, JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular choice for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of securely transmitting claims between parties as a JSON object. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing, while the payload holds the claims or information about the user. To implement JWT authentication in a Spring Boot application, you'll typically follow these steps:

### 1) User Authentication: 
First, the user needs to provide their credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication endpoint of the application. Spring Security, a powerful security framework, is often used to handle this process. Once the user credentials are verified, a JWT is generated and returned as the authentication response.

### 2) Token Generation: 
The generated JWT consists of a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically includes the algorithm used for signing the token, such as HMAC or RSA. The payload contains claims about the user, such as the username, roles, or any other relevant information. These claims are typically encoded in Base64 format.

### 3) Token Storage: 
In Spring Boot, the generated JWT can be stored on the client-side, usually in local storage or cookies. The client is responsible for sending the JWT with each subsequent request to the server.

### 4) Token Verification: 
When a protected resource is accessed, the client includes the JWT in the request's Authorization header. On the server side, a filter intercepts the request and verifies the validity of the JWT. The verification process involves checking the signature, validating the token's expiration time, and ensuring that the token has not been tampered with.

### 5) User Authorization: 
Once the JWT is verified, the server can extract the user information from the token's payload. This information can be used to perform authorization checks, such as verifying the user's roles and permissions to determine if they are allowed to access the requested resource.

### 6) Securing Endpoints: 
Spring Security allows you to secure your application's endpoints based on user roles and permissions. By applying appropriate security configurations, you can specify which endpoints are accessible to different user roles.

By implementing JWT authentication in Spring Boot, you can provide stateless and scalable authentication and authorization mechanisms for your application. JWTs eliminate the need to store session information on the server-side, making it suitable for distributed and microservice-based architectures.
